## CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was my favorite because it marked the beginning of my coding journey. It was a fairly simple and quick project that showed me the ropes of coding. Also, it introduced me to using GitHub

* Lab 6

    I liked Lab 6 because it reinforced my ability to effectively use command-line arguments in my code. It included a fun Blackjack game that was interesting. This project also helped me learn how to use functions. 

* Lab 7 

    Lab 8 was one of my favorites because it was the first lab that I was able to fully figure out on my own. It had a fun mad-lib game that reminded me of my childhood. This project helped me learn how to count arguments.
